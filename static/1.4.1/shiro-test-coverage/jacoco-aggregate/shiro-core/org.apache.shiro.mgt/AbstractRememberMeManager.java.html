/**
 * Abstract implementation of the {@code RememberMeManager} interface that handles
 * {@link #setSerializer(org.apache.shiro.io.Serializer) serialization} and
 * {@link #setCipherService encryption} of the remembered user identity.
 * &lt;p/&gt;
 * The remembered identity storage location and details are left to subclasses.
 * &lt;h2&gt;Default encryption key&lt;/h2&gt;
 * This implementation uses an {@link AesCipherService AesCipherService} for strong encryption by default.  It also
 * uses a default generated symmetric key to both encrypt and decrypt data.  As AES is a symmetric cipher, the same
 * {@code key} is used to both encrypt and decrypt data, BUT NOTE:
 * &lt;p/&gt;
 * Because Shiro is an open-source project, if anyone knew that you were using Shiro's default
 * {@code key}, they could download/view the source, and with enough effort, reconstruct the {@code key}
 * and decode encrypted data at will.
 * &lt;p/&gt;
 * Of course, this key is only really used to encrypt the remembered {@code PrincipalCollection} which is typically
 * a user id or username.  So if you do not consider that sensitive information, and you think the default key still
 * makes things 'sufficiently difficult', then you can ignore this issue.
 * &lt;p/&gt;
 * However, if you do feel this constitutes sensitive information, it is recommended that you provide your own
 * {@code key} via the {@link #setCipherKey setCipherKey} method to a key known only to your application,
 * guaranteeing that no third party can decrypt your data.  You can generate your own key by calling the
 * {@code CipherService}'s {@link org.apache.shiro.crypto.AesCipherService#generateNewKey() generateNewKey} method
 * and using that result as the {@link #setCipherKey cipherKey} configuration attribute.
