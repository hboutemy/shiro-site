/**
 * A default event bus implementation that synchronously publishes events to registered listeners.  Listeners can be
 * registered or unregistered for events as necessary.
 * &lt;p/&gt;
 * An event bus enables a publish/subscribe paradigm within Shiro - components can publish or consume events they
 * find relevant without needing to be tightly coupled to other components.  This affords great
 * flexibility within Shiro by promoting loose coupling and high cohesion between components and a much safer
 * pluggable architecture that is more resilient to change over time.
 * &lt;h2&gt;Sending Events&lt;/h2&gt;
 * If a component wishes to publish events to other components:
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 *     MyEvent myEvent = createMyEvent();
 *     eventBus.publish(myEvent);
 * &lt;/pre&gt;
 * The event bus will determine the type of event and then dispatch the event to components that wish to receive
 * events of that type.
 * &lt;h2&gt;Receiving Events&lt;/h2&gt;
 * A component can receive events of interest by doing the following.
 * &lt;ol&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;For each type of event you wish to consume, create a public method that accepts a single event argument.
 * The method argument type indicates the type of event to receive.&lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;Annotate each of these public methods with the {@link org.apache.shiro.event.Subscribe Subscribe} annotation.&lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;Register the component with the event bus:
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 *         eventBus.register(myComponent);
 *     &lt;/pre&gt;
 * &lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;/ol&gt;
 * After registering the component, when when an event of a respective type is published, the component's
 * {@code Subscribe}-annotated method(s) will be invoked as expected.
 *
 * This design (and its constituent helper components) was largely influenced by
 * Guava's &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.guava-libraries.googlecode.com/git/javadoc/com/google/common/eventbus/EventBus.html&quot;&gt;EventBus&lt;/a&gt;
 * concept, although no code was shared/imported (even though Guava is Apache 2.0 licensed and could have
 * been used).
 *
 * This implementation is thread-safe and may be used concurrently.
 *
 * @since 1.3

    //We want to preserve registration order to deliver events to objects in the order that they are registered
    //with the event bus.  This has the nice effect that any Shiro system-level components that are registered first
    //(likely to happen upon startup) have precedence over those registered by end-user components later.
    //
    //One might think that this could have been done by just using a ConcurrentSkipListMap (which is available only on
    //JDK 6 or later).  However, this approach requires the implementation of a Comparator to sort elements, and this
    //surfaces a problem: for any given random event listener, there isn't any guaranteed property to exist that can be
    //inspected to determine order of registration, since registration order is an artifact of this EventBus
    //implementation, not the listeners themselves.
    //
    //Therefore, we use a simple concurrent lock to wrap a LinkedHashMap - the LinkedHashMap retains insertion order
    //and the lock provides thread-safety in probably a much simpler mechanism than attempting to write a
    //EventBus-specific Comparator.  This technique is also likely to be faster than a ConcurrentSkipListMap, which
    //is about 3-5 times slower than a standard ConcurrentMap.
