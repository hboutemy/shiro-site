/**
 * A {@code SubjectCallable} associates a {@link Subject Subject} with a target/delegate
 * {@link Callable Callable} to ensure proper {@code Subject} thread-state management when the {@code Callable} executes.
 * This ensures that any calls to {@code SecurityUtils.}{@link org.apache.shiro.SecurityUtils#getSubject() getSubject()}
 * during the target {@code Callable}'s execution still work correctly even if the {@code Callable} executes on a
 * different thread than the one that created it.  This allows {@code Subject} access during asynchronous operations.
 * &lt;p/&gt;
 * When instances of this class execute (typically via a {@link java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService ExecutorService}),
 * the following occurs:
 * &lt;ol&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;The specified Subject any of its associated thread state is first bound to the thread that executes the
 * {@code Callable}.&lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;The delegate/target {@code Callable} is {@link java.util.concurrent.Callable#call() executed}&lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;The previous thread state that might have existed before the {@code Subject} was bound is fully restored&lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;/ol&gt;
 * &lt;p/&gt;
 * This behavior ensures that the thread that executes this {@code Callable}, which is often a different thread than
 * the one that created the instance, retains a {@code Subject} to support {@code SecurityUtils.getSubject()}
 * invocations. It also guarantees that the running thread remains 'clean' in any thread-pooled environments.
 *
 * &lt;h3&gt;Usage&lt;/h3&gt;
 *
 * This is typically considered a support class and is not often directly referenced.  Most people prefer to use
 * the {@code Subject.}{@link Subject#associateWith(Callable) associateWith} method, which will automatically return
 * an instance of this class.
 * &lt;p/&gt;
 * An even more convenient alternative is to use a
 * {@link org.apache.shiro.concurrent.SubjectAwareExecutorService SubjectAwareExecutorService}, which
 * transparently uses instances of this class.
 *
 * @see Subject#associateWith(Callable)
 * @see org.apache.shiro.concurrent.SubjectAwareExecutorService SubjectAwareExecutorService
