/**
 * A {@code SubjectRunnable} ensures that a target/delegate {@link Runnable Runnable} will execute such that any
 * call to {@code SecurityUtils.}{@link org.apache.shiro.SecurityUtils#getSubject() getSubject()} during the
 * {@code Runnable}'s execution will return the associated {@code Subject} instance.  The {@code SubjectRunnable}
 * instance can be run on any thread (the current thread or asynchronously on another thread) and the
 * {@code SecurityUtils.getSubject()} call will still work properly.  This implementation also guarantees that Shiro's
 * thread state will be identical before and after execution to ensure threads remain clean in any thread-pooled
 * environment.
 * &lt;p/&gt;
 * When instances of this class {@link Runnable#run() run()}, the following occurs:
 * &lt;ol&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;The Subject and any of its associated thread state is first bound to the thread that executes the
 * {@code Runnable}.&lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;The delegate/target {@code Runnable} is {@link #doRun(Runnable) run}&lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;Any previous thread state that might have existed before the {@code Subject} was bound is fully restored&lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;/ol&gt;
 * &lt;p/&gt;
 *
 * &lt;h3&gt;Usage&lt;/h3&gt;
 *
 * This is typically considered a support class and is not often directly referenced.  Most people prefer to use
 * the {@code Subject.}{@link Subject#execute(Runnable) execute} or
 * {@code Subject.}{@link Subject#associateWith(Runnable) associateWith} methods, which transparently perform the
 * necessary association logic.
 * &lt;p/&gt;
 * An even more convenient alternative is to use a
 * {@link org.apache.shiro.concurrent.SubjectAwareExecutor SubjectAwareExecutor}, which transparently uses
 * instances of this class but does not require referencing Shiro's API at all.
 *
 * @see Subject#associateWith(Runnable)
