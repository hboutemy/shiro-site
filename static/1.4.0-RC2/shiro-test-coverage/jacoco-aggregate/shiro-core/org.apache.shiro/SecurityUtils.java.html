     * Sets a VM (static) singleton SecurityManager, specifically for transparent use in the

     * &lt;p/&gt;
     * &lt;b&gt;This method call exists mainly for framework development support.  Application developers should rarely,
     * if ever, need to call this method.&lt;/b&gt;
     * &lt;p/&gt;
     * The Shiro development team prefers that SecurityManager instances are non-static application singletons
     * and &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; VM static singletons.  Application singletons that do not use static memory require some sort
     * of application configuration framework to maintain the application-wide SecurityManager instance for you
     * (for example, Spring or EJB3 environments) such that the object reference does not need to be static.
     * &lt;p/&gt;
     * In these environments, Shiro acquires Subject data based on the currently executing Thread via its own
     * framework integration code, and this is the preferred way to use Shiro.
     * &lt;p/&gt;
     * However in some environments, such as a standalone desktop application or Applets that do not use Spring or
     * EJB or similar config frameworks, a VM-singleton might make more sense (although the former is still preferred).
     * In these environments, setting the SecurityManager via this method will automatically enable the
     * {@link #getSubject() getSubject()} call to function with little configuration.
     * &lt;p/&gt;
     * For example, in these environments, this will work:
     * &lt;pre&gt;
     * DefaultSecurityManager securityManager = new {@link org.apache.shiro.mgt.DefaultSecurityManager DefaultSecurityManager}();
     * securityManager.setRealms( ... ); //one or more Realms
     * &lt;b&gt;SecurityUtils.setSecurityManager( securityManager );&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
     * &lt;p/&gt;
     * And then anywhere in the application code, the following call will return the application's Subject:
     * &lt;pre&gt;
     * Subject currentUser = SecurityUtils.getSubject();&lt;/pre&gt;
     *
     * @param securityManager the securityManager instance to set as a VM static singleton.

     * This implementation favors acquiring a thread-bound {@code SecurityManager} if it can find one.  If one is
