/**
 * A {@code HashedCredentialMatcher} provides support for hashing of supplied {@code AuthenticationToken} credentials
 * before being compared to those in the {@code AuthenticationInfo} from the data store.
 * &lt;p/&gt;
 * Credential hashing is one of the most common security techniques when safeguarding a user's private credentials
 * (passwords, keys, etc).  Most developers never want to store their users' credentials in plain form, viewable by
 * anyone, so they often hash the users' credentials before they are saved in the data store.
 * &lt;p/&gt;
 * This class (and its subclasses) function as follows:
 * &lt;ol&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;Hash the {@code AuthenticationToken} credentials supplied by the user during their login.&lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;Compare this hashed value directly with the {@code AuthenticationInfo} credentials stored in the system
 * (the stored account credentials are expected to already be in hashed form).&lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;If these two values are {@link #equals(Object, Object) equal}, the submitted credentials match, otherwise
 * they do not.&lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;/ol&gt;
 * &lt;h2&gt;Salting and Multiple Hash Iterations&lt;/h2&gt;
 * Because simple hashing is usually not good enough for secure applications, this class also supports 'salting'
 * and multiple hash iterations.  Please read this excellent
 * &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Hashing_Java&quot; _target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;Hashing Java article&lt;/a&gt; to learn about
 * salting and multiple iterations and why you might want to use them. (Note of sections 5
 * &amp;quot;Why add salt?&amp;quot; and 6 &quot;Hardening against the attacker's attack&quot;).   We should also note here that all of
 * Shiro's Hash implementations (for example, {@link org.apache.shiro.crypto.hash.Md5Hash Md5Hash},
 * {@link org.apache.shiro.crypto.hash.Sha1Hash Sha1Hash}, etc) support salting and multiple hash iterations via
 * overloaded constructors.
 * &lt;h4&gt;Real World Case Study&lt;/h4&gt;
 * In April 2010, some public Atlassian Jira and Confluence
 * installations (Apache Software Foundation, Codehaus, etc) were the target of account attacks and user accounts
 * were compromised.  The reason?  Jira and Confluence at the time did not salt user passwords and attackers were
 * able to use dictionary attacks to compromise user accounts (Atlassian has since
 * &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.atlassian.com/news/2010/04/oh_man_what_a_day_an_update_on_our_security_breach.html&quot;&gt;
 * fixed the problem&lt;/a&gt; of course).
 * &lt;p/&gt;
 * The lesson?
 * &lt;p/&gt;
 * &lt;b&gt;ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS SALT USER PASSWORDS!&lt;/b&gt;
 * &lt;p/&gt;
 * &lt;h3&gt;Salting&lt;/h3&gt;
 * Prior to Shiro 1.1, salts could be obtained based on the end-user submitted
 * {@link AuthenticationToken AuthenticationToken} via the now-deprecated
 * {@link #getSalt(org.apache.shiro.authc.AuthenticationToken) getSalt(AuthenticationToken)} method.  This however
 * could constitute a security hole since ideally salts should never be obtained based on what a user can submit.
 * User-submitted salt mechanisms are &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; more susceptible to dictionary attacks and &lt;b&gt;SHOULD NOT&lt;/b&gt; be
 * used in secure systems.  Instead salts should ideally be a secure randomly-generated number that is generated when
 * the user account is created.  The secure number should never be disseminated to the user and always kept private
 * by the application.
 * &lt;h4&gt;Shiro 1.1&lt;/h4&gt;
 * As of Shiro 1.1, it is expected that any salt used to hash the submitted credentials will be obtained from the
 * stored account information (represented as an {@link AuthenticationInfo AuthenticationInfo} instance).  This is much
 * more secure because the salt value remains private to the application (Shiro will never store this value).
 * &lt;p/&gt;
 * To enable this, {@code Realm}s should return {@link SaltedAuthenticationInfo SaltedAuthenticationInfo} instances
 * during authentication.  {@code HashedCredentialsMatcher} implementations will then use the provided
 * {@link org.apache.shiro.authc.SaltedAuthenticationInfo#getCredentialsSalt credentialsSalt} for hashing.  To avoid
 * security risks,
 * &lt;b&gt;it is highly recommended that any existing {@code Realm} implementations that support hashed credentials are
 * updated to return {@link SaltedAuthenticationInfo SaltedAuthenticationInfo} instances as soon as possible&lt;/b&gt;.
 * &lt;h4&gt;Shiro 1.0 Backwards Compatibility&lt;/h4&gt;
 * Because of the identified security risk, {@code Realm} implementations that support credentials hashing should
 * be updated to return {@link SaltedAuthenticationInfo SaltedAuthenticationInfo} instances as
 * soon as possible.
 * &lt;p/&gt;
 * If this is not possible for some reason, this class will retain 1.0 backwards-compatible behavior of obtaining
 * the salt via the now-deprecated {@link #getSalt(AuthenticationToken) getSalt(AuthenticationToken)} method.  This
 * method will only be invoked if a {@code Realm} &lt;em&gt;does not&lt;/em&gt; return
 * {@link SaltedAuthenticationInfo SaltedAutenticationInfo} instances and {@link #isHashSalted() hashSalted} is
 * {@code true}.
 * But please note that the {@link #isHashSalted() hashSalted} property and the
 * {@link #getSalt(AuthenticationToken) getSalt(AuthenticationToken)} methods will be removed before the Shiro 2.0
 * release.
 * &lt;h3&gt;Multiple Hash Iterations&lt;/h3&gt;
 * If you hash your users' credentials multiple times before persisting to the data store, you will also need to
 * set this class's {@link #setHashIterations(int) hashIterations} property.  See the
 * &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Hashing_Java&quot; _target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;Hashing Java article&lt;/a&gt;'s
 * &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Hashing_Java#Hardening_against_the_attacker.27s_attack&quot;&gt;
 * &amp;quot;Hardening against the attacker's attack&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; section to learn more about why you might want to use
 * multiple hash iterations.
 * &lt;h2&gt;MD5 &amp;amp; SHA-1 Notice&lt;/h2&gt;
 * &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5&quot;&gt;MD5&lt;/a&gt; and
 * &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA_hash_functions&quot;&gt;SHA-1&lt;/a&gt; algorithms are now known to be vulnerable to
 * compromise and/or collisions (read the linked pages for more).  While most applications are ok with either of these
 * two, if your application mandates high security, use the SHA-256 (or higher) hashing algorithms and their
 * supporting {@code CredentialsMatcher} implementations.
